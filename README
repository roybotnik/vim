This is what I use to work with rails in vim.  If you want to try it out, copy all of the folders into your 
.vim directory and copy .vimrc to your home directory.

Contains:

rails.vim
NERD_tree.vim
buftabs.vim (simple buffer list in status bar)
bclose.vim (closes buffers without destroying window arrangement)
vividchalk theme
