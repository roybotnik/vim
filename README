This is what I use to work with rails in vim.  I like to have very IDE-like behavior since I do a ton of 
jumping around between files within rails projects and I never liked leaving tons of buffers open.  

To use: copy all of the folders into your .vim directory and copy .vimrc to your home directory.

Contains:

rails.vim
NERD_tree.vim
buftabs.vim (simple buffer list in status bar)
bclose.vim (closes buffers without destroying window arrangement)
vividchalk theme
