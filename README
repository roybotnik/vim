This is what I use to work with rails in vim.  

To use: create symbolic links to vim directory and vimrc in your home dir.

Contains:

rails.vim
NERD_tree.vim
tabbar.vim (most tab-like buffer manager i've found)
bclose.vim (closes buffers without destroying window arrangement)
vividchalk theme

Config Settings:

Arrows switch between splits (left right up down)
Ctrl-right and Ctrl-left switch between next and prev buffers
, is leader
