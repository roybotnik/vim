Bindings:

* Arrow keys switch between splits
* `Ctrl-Right` and `Ctrl-Reft` switch between next and prev buffers
* `,` is leader
* `Tab` brings up buffer list
* `Shift-Tab` toggles NERDTree

Things:

* `,q` closes a buffer without messing up window arrangement
* `,p` pastes from 0 buffer that yanks go into
* `,t` opens ctrlp file finder
